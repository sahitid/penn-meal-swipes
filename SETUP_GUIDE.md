### Step 6: Matching Process

Since we're using Google Sheets, matching can be done in several ways:

#### Manual Matching (Simplest)
1. Review the two response sheets weekly
2. Look for compatible availability, dining halls, and interests
3. Send intro emails connecting both students
4. Record matches in the "Matches" tab

#### Semi-Automated Matching
Use Google Sheets formulas to highlight potential matches:
- VLOOKUP to find overlapping availability
- FILTER to show compatible pairs
- Conditional formatting to highlight good matches

#### Email Template for Matches
```
Subject: Penn Meal Swipe Match - [Underclassman Name] & [Upperclassman Name]
