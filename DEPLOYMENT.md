    requestFormUrl: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_FORM_REQUEST_URL',
    spreadsheetUrl: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_URL'
};
```

### 2. Test Everything

- [ ] Open your website URL
- [ ] Click "Offer Meal Swipes" â†’ Does the form load?
- [ ] Click "Request a Meal" â†’ Does the form load?
- [ ] Click "View All Offers & Requests" â†’ Does the sheet open?

- [ ] Submit a test form

### 3. Share Your Link!

Once everything works:
- Add link to Instagram bio

- Post on Penn Reddit/Facebook
- Email student organizations

## Troubleshooting

### Forms Not Loading?
- Make sure URLs in `script.js` are correct
- Check that forms are set to "Anyone with the link can respond"
- Try the form URLs directly in a browser

### Sheet Not Opening?
- Check sharing settings (should be "Anyone with the link can view")
- Make sure the URL is correct in `script.js`

### Website Looks Broken?
- Make sure BOTH `index.html` and `script.js` are uploaded
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Changes Not Showing?
- GitHub Pages: Wait 1-2 minutes
- Netlify/Vercel: Should be instant
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## Custom Domain (Optional)

Want `pennmealswipes.com` instead of a random URL?

### 1. Buy a Domain
- Namecheap.com (~$10/year for .com)
- Google Domains (~$12/year)
- Choose: `pennmealswipes.com`

### 2. Connect to Your Host

**For GitHub Pages:**
- Add a file named `CNAME` with your domain
- Update DNS records at your domain registrar

**For Netlify/Vercel:**
- Go to domain settings
- Follow their setup wizard (super easy!)
- They'll give you DNS records to add

### 3. Wait
- DNS changes take 1-48 hours
- Usually works within 1 hour
