# How to Deploy Google Apps Script as Web App

## Visual Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open Apps Script Editor

1. Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ioLhZ6zvFgUro4eiQe7ro7jJe20J6gL6kEgHCelDS-8/edit
2. Click **Extensions** ‚Üí **Apps Script**
3. A new tab will open

### Step 2: Add the Script

1. **Select all** existing code (Ctrl+A) and delete it
2. **Copy ALL the code** from `google-apps-script.js`
3. **Paste** it into the Apps Script editor
4. Click **File ‚Üí Save** (or Ctrl+S)
5. Name it: "Penn Meal Swipe Script"

### Step 3: Deploy as Web App

1. Click **Deploy** button (top right corner)
2. Click **"New deployment"**
3. You'll see a deployment configuration screen

### Step 4: Configure the Deployment

Click the **‚öôÔ∏è gear icon** next to "Select type" and choose **"Web app"**

Fill in these settings:

- **Description**: `Penn Meal Swipe API`
- **Execute as**: Select **"Me (your email)"**
- **Who has access**: Select **"Anyone"** (this is important!)

### Step 5: Deploy

1. Click the blue **"Deploy"** button
2. You'll see a popup asking for authorization
3. Click **"Authorize access"**

### Step 6: Grant Permissions

You'll see a Google authorization screen:

1. Select your Penn email account
2. You might see "This app isn't verified" - Click **"Advanced"**
3. Click **"Go to Penn Meal Swipe Script (unsafe)"** (it's safe - it's YOUR script!)
4. Review permissions and click **"Allow"**

### Step 7: Copy the Web App URL

After authorization, you'll see a success screen with:

- **Web app URL**: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbz...long-string.../exec`

**COPY THIS ENTIRE URL!** ‚Üê This is what you need!

### Step 8: Add URL to script.js

1. Open `script.js` in your code editor
2. Find the `CONFIG` object at the top (around line 2-8)
3. Replace `'YOUR_WEB_APP_URL_HERE'` with your actual URL:

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    offerFormUrl: 'https://forms.gle/L77FXngX4refmx6r8',
    requestFormUrl: 'https://forms.gle/iwvJteS8xT8HyqKR7',
    spreadsheetUrl: 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ioLhZ6zvFgUro4eiQe7ro7jJe20J6gL6kEgHCelDS-8/edit?usp=sharing',
    apiUrl: 'YOUR_WEB_APP_URL_HERE' // ‚Üê UPDATE THIS
};
```

**AFTER:**
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    offerFormUrl: 'https://forms.gle/L77FXngX4refmx6r8',
    requestFormUrl: 'https://forms.gle/iwvJteS8xT8HyqKR7',
    spreadsheetUrl: 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ioLhZ6zvFgUro4eiQe7ro7jJe20J6gL6kEgHCelDS-8/edit?usp=sharing',
    apiUrl: 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/exec' // ‚Üê YOUR ACTUAL URL
};
```

4. **Save** the file

### Step 9: Test It!

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Scroll down to "Browse Available Meal Swipes"
3. You should see either:
   - ‚úÖ Real data from your spreadsheet (if you have submissions)
   - ‚úÖ "No meal swipes available yet" (if sheet is empty)
   - ‚ùå Error message (if something went wrong)

## Troubleshooting

### "API not configured" still shows?

- Make sure you saved `script.js` after adding the URL
- Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 for hard refresh)
- Check that the URL ends with `/exec` not `/dev`

### "Authorization required" error?

- Go back to Apps Script
- Click **Deploy ‚Üí Manage deployments**
- Make sure "Who has access" is set to **"Anyone"**
- If not, click Edit (pencil icon) ‚Üí Change to "Anyone" ‚Üí Update

### Seeing "Script error" or "Permission denied"?

- Go back to Apps Script
- Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Run** button at the top
- Select the `doGet` function from dropdown
- Click Run to authorize it manually
- Grant permissions

### Cards not showing up?

1. **Check if you have data in the sheet:**
   - Go to your Google Sheet
   - Make sure the "Offer Swipes Responses" sheet has data rows (not just headers)

2. **Test the API directly:**
   - Copy your Web App URL
   - Paste it in your browser address bar
   - You should see JSON data like: `{"success":true,"offers":[...]}`
   - If you see `{"success":true,"offers":[],"count":0}` - your sheet is empty
   - If you see an error - check the deployment settings

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Click "Console" tab
   - Look for error messages
   - Share them if you need help

### Need to update the script later?

If you make changes to `google-apps-script.js`:

1. Paste the new code in Apps Script editor
2. Save it
3. Go to **Deploy ‚Üí Manage deployments**
4. Click the **‚úèÔ∏è pencil icon** next to your deployment
5. Under "Version": select **"New version"**
6. Click **Update**
7. The URL stays the same (no need to update script.js again!)

## Important Notes

- **URL ends with `/exec`** - this is the production URL
- **Don't use `/dev`** - that's for testing and requires authentication
- **"Anyone" access is safe** - the script only returns public offer data (no sensitive info)
- **Email addresses are NOT exposed** - the API doesn't share them publicly
- **Free tier limits**: 
  - 100 emails per day
  - 20,000 URL fetches per day
  - Plenty for a student project!
