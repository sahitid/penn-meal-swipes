## 🧮 Matching Algorithm Deep Dive

### Overview

The matching algorithm is a **weighted scoring system** that runs automatically whenever a new form submission is received. It compares the new submission against all existing submissions of the opposite type (offers vs. requests) and calculates a compatibility score.

### When Matching Occurs

Matching is triggered automatically by two functions:

1. **`onOfferSubmit(e)`** - Runs when an underclassman submits an offer
2. **`onRequestSubmit(e)`** - Runs when an upperclassman submits a request

Both functions:
- Send a confirmation email to the submitter
- Immediately run the matching algorithm
- Search for compatible matches in the opposite pool

### Matching Process

#### Step 1: Load Candidate Pool

- **For new offers**: Load all existing requests from the "Request Meals Responses" sheet
- **For new requests**: Load all existing offers from the "Offer Swipes Responses" sheet

#### Step 2: Calculate Match Score

For each potential match, the algorithm calls `calculateMatchScore(offer, request)` which computes a score from 0.0 to 1.0 using three weighted factors:

```javascript
Total Score = (Availability Score × 40%) 
            + (Dining Hall Score × 30%) 
            + (Interests Score × 30%)
```

**A. Availability Match (40% weight)**
- **Purpose**: Ensures students can actually meet
- **Method**: Compares time slots (e.g., "Monday lunch, Tuesday dinner")
- **Calculation**: Uses `calculateOverlap()` function
  - Splits availability strings by commas/semicolons
  - Counts overlapping time slots (substring matching)
  - Score = `overlapping_items / max(items_in_either_list)`
- **Example**: 
  - Offer: "Monday lunch, Tuesday dinner, Friday lunch"
  - Request: "Monday lunch, Wednesday dinner"
  - Overlap: 1 item (Monday lunch)
  - Score: 1/3 = 0.33 → Weighted: 0.33 × 0.4 = 0.132

**B. Dining Hall Match (30% weight)**
- **Purpose**: Ensures students prefer compatible locations
- **Method**: Compares preferred dining halls (e.g., "Hill, Commons")
- **Calculation**: Uses same `calculateOverlap()` function
- **Requirement**: At least one shared dining hall for meaningful match
- **Example**:
  - Offer: "Hill, Commons"
  - Request: "Hill"
  - Overlap: 1 item (Hill)
  - Score: 1/2 = 0.5 → Weighted: 0.5 × 0.3 = 0.15

**C. Interests Similarity (30% weight)**
- **Purpose**: Increases likelihood of good conversation
- **Method**: Compares "About Me" text fields
- **Calculation**: Uses `calculateTextSimilarity()` function
  - Splits text into words
  - Finds common words (length > 3 characters, substring matching)
  - Score = `common_words / max(words_in_either_text)`
- **Example**:
  - Offer: "I love basketball and entrepreneurship"
  - Request: "Basketball player, interested in startups"
  - Common words: "basketball", "entrepreneurship/startups"
  - Score: 2/5 = 0.4 → Weighted: 0.4 × 0.3 = 0.12

#### Step 3: Filter and Rank

- **Threshold**: Only matches with score ≥ **0.6 (60%)** are considered valid
- **Ranking**: All valid matches are sorted by score (highest first)
- **Selection**: Only the **top match** is processed (prevents notification overload)

#### Step 4: Notify and Record

If a valid match exists:

1. **Send Match Notifications**:
   - Both students receive personalized emails via `sendMatchNotification()`
   - Email includes:
     - Partner's name, year, school
     - Contact information (email)
     - Availability preferences
     - Interests/About Me section
     - Next steps for coordination

2. **Record Match**:
   - Match saved to "Matches" sheet via `recordMatch()`
   - Records:
     - Match date/timestamp
     - Both students' names and emails
     - Match score (for analytics)
     - Status: "Pending" (can be updated to "Completed" manually)

### Helper Functions

**`calculateOverlap(str1, str2)`**
```javascript
// Purpose: Find overlapping items between two comma-separated strings
// Returns: Score from 0.0 to 1.0
// Example: "Hill, Commons" vs "Hill" → 0.5
```

**`calculateTextSimilarity(text1, text2)`**
```javascript
// Purpose: Find common words between two text fields
// Returns: Score from 0.0 to 1.0
// Filters: Only words longer than 3 characters
// Example: "basketball entrepreneurship" vs "basketball startups" → 0.4
```

### Example Match Calculation

**Scenario**: New offer submitted, checking against existing requests

**New Offer:**
- Availability: "Monday lunch, Tuesday dinner, Friday lunch"
- Dining halls: "Hill, Commons"
- Interests: "I love basketball and entrepreneurship"

**Existing Request:**
- Availability: "Monday lunch, Wednesday dinner"
- Dining halls: "Hill"
- Interests: "Basketball player, interested in startups"

**Score Calculation:**

1. **Availability**: 
   - Overlap: 1 (Monday lunch)
   - Max items: 3
   - Score: 1/3 = 0.33
   - Weighted: 0.33 × 0.4 = **0.132**

2. **Dining Halls**:
   - Overlap: 1 (Hill)
   - Max items: 2
   - Score: 1/2 = 0.5
   - Weighted: 0.5 × 0.3 = **0.15**

3. **Interests**:
   - Common words: "basketball", "entrepreneurship/startups" (2 words)
   - Max words: 5
   - Score: 2/5 = 0.4
   - Weighted: 0.4 × 0.3 = **0.12**

**Total Score**: 0.132 + 0.15 + 0.12 = **0.402 (40.2%)**

**Result**: ❌ **No match** (below 60% threshold)

**Better Match Example:**

**Offer:**
- Availability: "Monday lunch, Tuesday dinner"
- Dining halls: "Hill, Commons"
- Interests: "Basketball, startups, tech"

**Request:**
- Availability: "Monday lunch, Tuesday dinner"
- Dining halls: "Hill"
- Interests: "Love basketball and tech startups"

**Score Calculation:**

1. **Availability**: 2/2 = 1.0 → 1.0 × 0.4 = **0.4**
2. **Dining Halls**: 1/2 = 0.5 → 0.5 × 0.3 = **0.15**
3. **Interests**: 3/5 = 0.6 → 0.6 × 0.3 = **0.18**

**Total Score**: 0.4 + 0.15 + 0.18 = **0.73 (73%)**

**Result**: ✅ **Match!** (above 60% threshold)

### Algorithm Configuration

The matching weights can be adjusted in `google-apps-script.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  weights: {
    availabilityMatch: 0.4,    // 40% - Schedule compatibility
    diningHallMatch: 0.3,       // 30% - Location preference
    interestsSimilarity: 0.3    // 30% - Shared interests
  }
};
```

**Current Threshold**: 0.6 (60%) - can be modified in `findMatchesForNewOffer()` and `findMatchesForNewRequest()`

### Manual Matching

The script includes `runManualMatching()` function for:
- **Bulk matching**: Check all offers against all requests
- **Catching missed matches**: Useful if algorithm wasn't running
- **Testing**: Verify matching logic works correctly

**Usage**: Run manually in Apps Script editor to find and send all possible matches.

### Design Decisions

1. **60% Threshold**: Balances match quality with match rate
   - Too low → Poor quality matches
   - Too high → Too few matches

2. **Weighted Factors**: Prioritizes schedule compatibility (40%)
   - Most important for successful meetings
   - Dining halls and interests are nice-to-haves

3. **Top Match Only**: Prevents notification overload
   - Students get one match at a time
   - Can request another match after meeting

4. **Automatic Execution**: Runs on every submission
   - No manual intervention needed
   - Immediate matching for new users

5. **Match Recording**: All matches saved for analytics
   - Track success rates
   - Identify patterns
   - Improve algorithm over time
