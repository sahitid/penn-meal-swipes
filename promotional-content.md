💙 Match of the Week 💙

Meet Sarah (Wharton '28) and Alex (Engineering '26)!

Sarah had 6 extra meal swipes and wanted to meet people outside her freshman dorm. Alex missed having a meal plan and wanted to connect with younger students.

We matched them last Monday, and they just had their 3rd lunch together at Hill! 🍽️

"I was nervous at first, but Alex gave me amazing advice about classes and even introduced me to her club!" - Sarah

"Sarah is so fun to hang with! I forgot how much I missed dining hall food (and the company!)" - Alex

## 🎤 Tabling Script

**What to Say When Students Approach Your Table:**

```
Opening:
"Hey! Are you an underclassman with extra meal swipes, or an upperclassman missing dining hall food?"

If Underclassman:
"Perfect! We match you with upperclassmen who'd love to share a meal with you. It's a great way to meet people outside your year, get advice, and actually use those swipes you'd otherwise lose. Want to sign up? It's literally two minutes."

If Upperclassman:
"Awesome! We match you with underclassmen who want to share their meal swipes with you—for free! You get free dining hall food and meet younger students. All you do is fill out a quick form and we'll email you when we find a match."

Handling Questions:
Q: "Is this safe?"
A: "Totally! You always meet in public dining halls, use Penn emails only, and you can bring a friend if you want. Plus, you coordinate everything yourself—we just do the introductions."

Q: "How long does it take?"
A: "Sign-up is 2 minutes. Matching usually happens within 48 hours. Then you coordinate directly with your match."

Q: "What if I don't like my match?"
A: "No commitment! You can request a different match anytime, or just not respond. Totally voluntary."

Q: "Does it cost money?"
A: "Nope! 100% free. It's student-run and community-driven."

Closing:
"Want to scan this QR code and sign up now? Or I can send you the link!"
